<h4><font  color=blue size=3><b>On-Demand Railway Bridge Structural Health Monitoring</b></font></h4>
Structural health monitoring for railway bridges is becoming an increasing requirement in transportation infrastructure management. More than 73,000 railway bridges older than 110 years in Europe. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides an appealing solution for railway bridge surveillance, condition assessment, and management. However, existing energy-efficient sensing approaches such as duty cycling and ambient energy harvesting face challenges in railway bridge health monitoring applications due to the unpredictability of train passages and insufficient ambient energy around bridges. We proposed EocVibe, the first railway bridge monitoring IoT system that provides on-demand sensing with near-zero idle energy dissipation. This research work was supported by VINNOVA.
