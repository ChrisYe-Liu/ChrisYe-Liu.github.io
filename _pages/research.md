The Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming a new fundamen- tal infrastructure worldwide. Over the past decade, dramatic numbers of IoT systems have been deployed for smart cities, Industry 4.0, and Agriculture 4.0 [1]. They not only help in productivity enhancement and cost reduction, but also benefit in improving quality of life and creating new opportunities. However, one key lesson learned from these experiences is that power supply will become a bottleneck for IoTâ€™s future devel- opment. First, battery is the primary power supply approach for IoT at the current stage. A limited capacity causes frequent battery replacement, which will be an unimaginable burden with the explosion of IoT devices. In addition, electronic waste due to battery disposal will be outrageous when the advent of trillions of IoT devices era. Furthermore, IoT systems in the future will often be deployed at hard-to-reach places Such applications are expected to achieve long-duration or even potentially perpetual monitoring with minimum maintenance.
