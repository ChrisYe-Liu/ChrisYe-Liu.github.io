<h4><font  color=blue size=3><b>On-Demand Railway Bridge Structural Health Monitoring</b></font></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Over 73,000 railway bridges are older than 110 years in Europe. The IoT is promising for railway bridge health monitoring. However, existing energy-efficient approaches, such as duty cycling and energy harvesting, face challenges in this application due to the unpredictability of train passages and insufficient ambient energy around bridges. We proposed EocVibe, the first railway bridge monitoring IoT system that provides on-demand sensing with near-zero idle energy dissipation. This research work was supported by VINNOVA.

<h4><font  color=blue size=3><b>Harvest Energy from Water: A Green Water Quality Sensing System</b></font></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
Water quality data is crucial and valuable, but its acquisition is not always trivial. A promising solution is to distribute a wireless sensor network in water to measure and collect the data. However, a drawback exists in that the system's batteries must be replaced or recharged after being exhausted. To mitigate this issue, we designed a self-sustained and on-demand water quality sensing system powered by renewable bioenergy from microbial fuel cells. This research work was supported by the Exploratory Advanced Research Program of FHWA.
